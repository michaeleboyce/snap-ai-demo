  - [ ] Identify duplicate patterns (cards, banners, badges, status pills, dialogs, section headers)

- [ ] Establish UI primitives library (`components/ui/*`)
  - [ ] `Button`, `Card` (header/body/footer slots), `Alert` (info/success/warning/error variants), `Badge/StatusPill`, `Dialog/Modal`, `Progress`, `Stat` (label/value), `SectionHeader`
  - [ ] Migrate `InfoCard` to use `Card` + `Alert` variants and deprecate custom ad-hoc banners
  - [ ] Consolidate all modals on top of base `Dialog` (headless, accessible)

- [ ] Consolidate dialogs/modals
  - [ ] Refactor `ConsentDialog` to use base `Dialog`
  - [ ] Extract generic `ConfirmDialog` and use it for ‚ÄúEnd Interview‚Äù confirmation
  - [ ] Create `ReviewDetailDialog` as a composition over `Dialog` for Staff Review

- [ ] Create renderless logic hooks (separate logic from view)
  - [ ] `useVoiceSession` wrapper around Realtime/VoicePipeline: lifecycle events, turn detection, idle handling, interruptions
  - [ ] `useInterviewTranscript` for message normalization, checkpoint saves, resume
  - [ ] `useCoverage` for debounced coverage evaluation and errors
  - [ ] `useCompletion` to unify completion detection: agent signal (INTERVIEW_COMPLETE) + coverage fallback + manual end

- [ ] Event bus and constants
  - [ ] Define custom events and channels in `lib/events.ts` (e.g., `interview:complete`, `interview:idle-warning`, `interview:idle-end`)
  - [ ] Replace ad-hoc window events with typed helpers

- [ ] Types and schemas
  - [ ] Centralize shared types in `types/` (`InterviewMessage`, `CoverageSections`, `InterviewSummary`, `InterviewStatus`)
  - [ ] Remove `any` usages; ensure `summary` is a typed JSON object across API/UI
  - [ ] Align server actions and pages on the same DTOs

- [ ] Layouts and composition
  - [ ] Introduce `PageLayout` with content/sidebar slots; apply to `Interview`, `Review`, `History`, `Staff Review`
  - [ ] Extract `StatusBadge` and reuse across `History`, `Review`, `Staff Review`
  - [ ] Unify ‚Äúdemo mode‚Äù indicators and contextual banners

- [ ] i18n and copy centralization
  - [ ] Move user-facing strings to a simple i18n setup (prep for Spanish)
  - [ ] Keep consent/disclosure copy in dedicated modules with translations

- [ ] Migration plan
  - [ ] Phase 1: Build primitives/hooks; adopt in `Interview` page
  - [ ] Phase 2: Migrate `Staff Review`, `Review`, `History`
  - [ ] Phase 3: Remove deprecated components and duplicate patterns

## Key Files to Review

### Core Implementation
- `/lib/realtime-agent.ts` - AI agent configuration and interview logic
- `/components/voice-interview.tsx` - Voice interface component with save/resume
- `/components/text-interview.tsx` - Text-based interview alternative
- `/components/interview-progress.tsx` - Real-time progress tracking
- `/app/interview/page.tsx` - Main interview page with mode selection
- `/app/interview/[sessionId]/review/page.tsx` - Interview review page
- `/app/interview-history/page.tsx` - Interview history listing
- `/app/actions/interviews.ts` - Server actions for interview management
- `/lib/db/schema.ts` - Database schema definitions
- `/app/api/generate-summary-v2/route.ts` - Summary generation endpoint

### Documentation
- `/AI_ARCHITECTURE_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Technical architecture
- `/VOICE_INTERVIEW_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Voice implementation details
- `/docs/PBIF_Grant_Proposal.pdf` - Original grant proposal

## Architecture Decisions

### Current Implementation
- **Server Actions**: Used for all database operations instead of API routes (except for streaming/technical operations)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Neon with Drizzle ORM for type-safe queries
- **State Management**: React hooks with local state, no global state management
- **Real-time Communication**: OpenAI Realtime API for voice, standard chat completions for text
- **Deployment**: Vercel with automatic deployments from main branch
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom component library

### Design Patterns
- **Component Composition**: Reusable UI components (InfoCard, MessageList, etc.)
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Voice mode with text fallback
- **Graceful Degradation**: Handle missing features without breaking
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: All automated decisions require human review

## Responsible AI Considerations

### Current Safeguards
- Human-in-the-loop review required
- Transparent AI disclosure to users
- Opt-out available at any time
- No automated decisions
- Full audit trail of conversations

### Planned Safeguards
- Bias testing across populations
- Regular accuracy assessments
- Privacy impact assessments
- Security controls (encryption, access control)
- Data retention policies

## Testing
